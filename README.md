There are a bunch of resources coming from parents and teachers at Arthur's school, Southwest Montessori Academy, for use in homeschooling the kids.

I think having a place to collect and organize those resources would be great.

Perhaps a Google Sheets spreadsheet will work.

Perhaps a web app would be nice.
